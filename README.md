# Dice Kingdom Clash

## Introduction
Dice Kingdom Clash is a 2-player turn-based game inspired by a minigame from Super Mario Party. Engage in an epic battle where the goal is to reduce your opponent's dice tower HP to zero and claim victory! To add excitement, I've introduced Power Dice, granting special abilities that can turn the tide of the game. Immerse yourself in this thrilling experience against a worthy opponent. This project was developed as part of my coursework for GA SEI-45.
